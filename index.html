    <p class ="intro">This website is all about fantasy football and how it ruins people's lives.
       This year there were a ton of fantasy busts, and some sleeper picks that turned
       out. But first, here are the nominees for the biggest fantasy football busts
       of 2016...</p><br>

    <h1> Busts... </h1>
    <article>
        <h2>1) Todd Gurley </h2>
        <h3> Why todd...why? </h3>
        <p> Talk about your all time fail... Todd just
            couldn't get things done. But then again...Rams. </p>

        <h2>2) Deandre Hopkins</h2>
        <h3> Yea we know...Osweiler is your QB </h3>
        <p> I rest all the blame on Osw...nvm. </p>

    <article>
        <h2>3) Allen Robinson </h2>
        <h3> We expected a dropoff...but this??! </h3>
        <p> A-rob wasn't slated to be quite the garbage time hero he was last year,
        but we also didn't expect him to play like a used car salesman. </p>

    <p id="rogue"> Now it's time for this year's winning lotto numbers...&yen; &euro; TALK ABOUT MONEY!!!

    <h1> Studs... </h1>
    <article>
        <h2>1) Melvin Gordon </h2>
        <h3> AP's protege... </h3>
        <p> It seems as if all of that hard offseason work with the legendary AP has really paid
        dividends, as Gordon produced top 5 fantasy RB numbers for a 6th round price.  </p>

    <article>
        <h2>2) Jordan Howard </h2>
        <h3> Where did he come from? </h3>
        <p> Everyone thought this job was Lankford's for the taking, but Howard came out
        of nowhere to steal the starting job and performed like a top ten RB, taking
        many teams to the championship.</p>

        <h2>3) Mike Evans </h2>
        <h3> Not exactly a sleeper, but...</h3>
        <p> While Mike Evans shouldn't be classified as a sleeper, based on his average draft
        position and the preseason negativity he was up against, finishing as the number
        one scoring WR in fantasy for a third round price counts as a huge win in my book!</p>
